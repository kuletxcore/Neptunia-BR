# THE PROJECT HAS NOW BEEN ARCHIVED
My old PC is dead and this project has been abandoned.

It was too ambitious to make a multiplayer Neptunia experience like no other, but unfortunately, we didn't have direction.

If you want to make your own, you can still fork this thing and add to it.

GGs and thank you!
